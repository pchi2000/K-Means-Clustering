# K-Means-Clustering
Assigns spike waveforms to one of two cluster groups. Read K_Means.pdf

The threshold-crossing waveform snippets contain approximately two different shapes meaning there are two neurons contributing to these waveforms. The K-means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm that assigns each waveform as belonging to one of the two clusters (neurons). 

This respository contains the raw code (.m file) and write-up (.pdf) as well as the data file used. Additionlly, there are notes that are referenced in the write-up.
