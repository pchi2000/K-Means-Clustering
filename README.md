# K-Means-Clustering
Assigns spike waveforms to one of two cluster groups

The threshold-Crossing waveform snippets contain approximately two different shapes meaning there are two neurons contributing to these waveforms. The K-means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm that assigns each waveform as belonging to one of the two clusters (neurons).
